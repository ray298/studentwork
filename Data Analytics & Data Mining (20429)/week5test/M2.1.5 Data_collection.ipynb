I will then ask you to review a number of articles and would like you to answer a few questions. These questions are not part of the CA, but will be really useful to drive a debate amongst yourselves.\n","\n","Data collection has been continually used throughout history. Census data was extremely important to most imperial powers incuding the Chinese, British and Incas empires. The Egyptians even recorded their beer usage as far back as 3000 BC. We still conduct censuses today and in Ireland we conduct one every five years, with the next one due in 2021. This data is very important for governments in order to help them determine strategies and national budgets. But private bodies also use this data to help them determine sampling strategies for marketing campaigns for example. We all intuitively collect data when we see something. It might be someones face that we see, and we immediately make conclusions (rightly and wrongly) about this person. In this example we are actually using a sample of information to make conclusions about the person in general. We also do this when we see groups of objects or people. We will collect some summary data and use this to make conclusions about the over population of objects or subjects. Obviouly, there is inherent bias in simplified sampling stategies, and in 1895 the formal recognition of sampling techniques was born. The article by [Jelke Bethlehem](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-lkuPhxlbXjonkprMmqW37nFMhdqldnv/view) discusses the history of this process. In this paper Bethlehem tells us about the use of the Central limit theorm. This theorem basically tells us that if we pick a random sample of 30 or more objects and repeat this process, the sample means will follow a normal distribution. The power this gives to an experimenter is vast and allows one to draw conclusions from a sample about a population. However, one must be careful to select the subjects correctly (this is no small task) in order to avoid bias and drawing the wrong conclusions. The data typically, studied during these times predominantly orginated from continous variables. We have however, advanced significantly in this regard. We now collect data from an enormous array of devices and in reality have a number of data types. As well as straight forward continous numbers, we now have categories, text and images. They all in some way come back to numbers but the analyst will be faced with transforming and preporcessing these data sources in order to integrate them into their analysis. This [article](https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-integration/) from telend is quite a nice view on how and why we need to do data integration. As you may have guessed by now,  data intergration has developed into a science of its own as we have expanded our data requirements.\n","\n","The introduction of IOT and vision technology for example has lead us into collecting vast amounts of data,known as big data. This article from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/02/17/the-big-data-revolution-will-be-sampled-how-big-data-has-come-to-mean-small-sampled-data/#7a8ea8199ec6) by Leetaru, tells us that sampling is still necessary as the cost of processing large batches of data is far greater than the storage cost. Leetaru states that the differential cost between storage and analysis has not really moved. You will also find over the duration of this course that you will be faced with similar problems. You can afford the storage but not the processing time. You will probably have to sample your data in order to build and process your models. Leetaru states you need to be really careful with this strategy, but it can be useful. When faced with this problem in the past I have used a term called bootstrapping, which  effectively selects samples of data, where each sample is processed and the results aggregated.\n","\n","\n","\n","In my industry career I have seen a number of projects  make serious mistakes in the data collection process. In many of these cases the investigator was unable to ask the question they wanted as the data collection process was flawed. Its important to note that in medical research the data collection process is key when attempting to conduct drug trials, and authorities put enormous emphasis on this during clinical trial submissions. You may find this in future projects, where the assessor or client is highly concerned with the data. This makes sense as we have already said,  wrongly collected data can bias your results and lead to wrong conclusions/forecasts. Some people believe that if they have petabytes of data they can predict anything. Not True. In fact a correctly selected small sample can have much better results than a ill conceived large sample.\n","\n","Before, we finish up I would like to draw your attention to [DCU's ethics policy](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_practicum/#Ethics) for data collection. Its worth nothing that you need to be really careful here. Remember, GDPR is now an active requirement. It requires anyone who stores personel data to put the correct conditions in place to ensure this information is secure and is used in an ethical fasion. One most be extremely careful with images, peoples identies and any potential data that could identify someone. This could be a piece of data that identifies someone who drives a particular brand of a car on a specific street. You may no give their name or house number, but if this car is unique to this street then the individual can be identified.\n","\n","Finally, I would like to add one last statement: **you will learn nothing if the data is incorectly collected.**\n","\n","* Can you think of ways of how data can be incorrectly collected? Try and post 2 or 3 on the comments section.\n","\n","* How much planning should you put into your data collection?\n","\n","* Does the question you are trying to answer come before the data collection or is it vise versa? What should it be and what actually happens in practice?\n","\n","These are open questions and one could argue them either way. I have opnions on these and when you have posted some answers I will share my thoughts.\n"]}]}
