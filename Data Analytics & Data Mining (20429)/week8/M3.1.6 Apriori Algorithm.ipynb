Processing the transaction database for each basket would take excessive amounts of time if we were to do so. The Apriori algoritthm, Algrawal and Srikant (1984), is probably one of the best known algorithms in Association Rules Mining. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database, using effectively 2 steps.\n","\n","* Find all itemsets that have minimum support\n","\n","* Use frequent itemsets to generate rules.\n","\n","In the example below we have 7 trasactions.\n","\n","</br>\n","\n","![alt text](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_images/simple_transaction_database.png)\n","\n","</br>\n","\n","So we can see from this transactional database that the rule $ Clothes {\\mapsto}Milk,Chicken $ has of $[sup= 3$ \\ $7,conf =3$ \\ $3]$ which is a frequent itemset. But if we started with $Boots$, we would get a support of $1$ \\ $7$ which means that we could not generate a frequent itemsets from it. So there wouldn't be any point starting with boots or in other words going down this part of the tree if we were looking for frequent itemsets. The Apriori algorithm can be explained in the with the following pseudo code:\n","![alt text](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_images/Apriori_algorithm_steps.png)\n","\n","\n","Lets look at another example and examine how it works\n","\n","![alt text](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_images/Transaction_example.png)\n","\n","So we have the following unique items in our database and they are {Bread,Milk,Diapers, Beer, Eggs, Cola}. We can see from the database that Milk occurs 4 times and Eggs only occurs 1. if we were to examine each individual item and the items in couples, tripples and so we would get a pattern such as that shown below. Now notice how we have a term called Minimum support\n","\n","\n","![alt text](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_images/Apriori_example.png)\n","\n","\n","In the next step we will complete a working example of the Apriori algorithm in Python.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset = [['Milk', 'Onion', 'Nutmeg', 'Kidney Beans', 'Eggs', 'Yogurt'],\n","           ['Dill', 'Onion', 'Nutmeg', 'Kidney Beans', 'Eggs', 'Yogurt'],\n","           ['Milk', 'Apple', 'Kidney Beans', 'Eggs'],\n","           ['Milk', 'Unicorn', 'Corn', 'Kidney Beans', 'Yogurt'],\n","           ['Corn', 'Onion', 'Onion', 'Kidney Beans', 'Ice cream', 'Eggs']]\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder\n","\n","te = TransactionEncoder()\n","te_ary = te.fit(dataset).transform(dataset)\n","df = pd.DataFrame(te_ary, columns=te.columns_)\n","print(df)\n","from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori\n","\n","print(apriori(df, min_support=0.6,use_colnames=True))"],"metadata":{"id":"7J1nRfhdh78w","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739973983403,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":1997,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew Mccarren","userId":"16186536572019350587"}},"outputId":"8c727bb3-3651-4096-9ffa-6f8932185366","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["   Apple   Corn   Dill   Eggs  Ice cream  Kidney Beans   Milk  Nutmeg  Onion  \\\n","0  False  False  False   True      False          True   True    True   True   \n","1  False  False   True   True      False          True  False    True   True   \n","2   True  False  False   True      False          True   True   False  False   \n","3  False   True  False  False      False          True   True   False  False   \n","4  False   True  False   True       True          True  False   False   True   \n","\n","   Unicorn  Yogurt  \n","0    False    True  \n","1    False    True  \n","2    False   False  \n","3     True    True  \n","4    False   False  \n","    support                     itemsets\n","0       0.8                       (Eggs)\n","1       1.0               (Kidney Beans)\n","2       0.6                       (Milk)\n","3       0.6                      (Onion)\n","4       0.6                     (Yogurt)\n","5       0.8         (Eggs, Kidney Beans)\n","6       0.6                (Eggs, Onion)\n","7       0.6         (Milk, Kidney Beans)\n","8       0.6        (Onion, Kidney Beans)\n","9       0.6       (Yogurt, Kidney Beans)\n","10      0.6  (Eggs, Onion, Kidney Beans)\n"]}]}]}
