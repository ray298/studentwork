The values that are shown in a contingency table are cross tabulations of dummy variables that have been derived from categorical factors. \n","\n","![](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_images/MCA_Smoking_data.png)\n","\n","**Table 1 (Greenacre (1984, p. 55)**\n","\n","\n","Now you might remember we used the $\\chi^2$ distribution on contigency tables to determine if there was a relationship between 2 factors such as those given in table 1, but it did not tell us what the components are, or the contribution that explained the relationship between rows. Recall that we used principal component analysis on continous variables to both reduce the dimensionality, handle correlatiion and tell us the contribution each row had to a factor(eigenvectors). Correspondence analysis (Multi) can be described has a descriptive/exploratory technique designed to analyze simple two-way and multi-way tables containing some measure of correspondence between the rows and columns. The results allow one to explore the structure of categorical variables included in the table. \n","\n","In a typical correspondence analysis, a crosstabulation table of frequencies   is first standardized, so that the relative frequencies across all cells sum to 1.0, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_analysis). One way to state the goal of a typical analysis is to represent the entries in the table of relative frequencies in terms of the distances between individual rows and/or columns in a low-dimensional space. This is best illustrated by a simple example, which will be described below. There are several parallels in interpretation between correspondence analysis and Factor Analysis, and some similar concepts will also be pointed out below.\n","\n","\n","\n","For a comprehensive description of this method, computational details, and its applications refer to the classic  by Greenacre (1984). These methods were originally developed primarily in France by Jean-Paul Benzécri in the early 1960's and 1970's (e.g., see Benzécri, 1973; see also Lebart, Morineau, and Tabard, 1977).\n","\n","</br>\n","\n","**Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)**\n","Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) orginates from correspondence analysis. In Correspondence analysis we predominantly work with 2 factors but this is extended to multiple factors in Multiple correspondence analysis.\n","\n","In the next step we will demonstrate how MCA can be implemented on a toy dataset. Another, more complex example can be found [here](http://vxy10.github.io/2016/06/10/intro-MCA/). This example uses a 3 dimensional categorical table and also calculates all the measurements from scratch and uses the Python MCA Library. I have used some of the code here on the toy example.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DsvTKfuZWuOr","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]}]}
