But the next question is how do we find the rules that are most useful to us. There are a number of techniques that we will examine in this Topic but to understand them we really need to examine the most basic approach which is known as the Brute Force Approach. It is as simple as it sounds, we are going to extract every possible rule that exists. Imagine you have 5 products {A,B,C,D,E} in a virtual store and that your customers can take any commination of the 5 products. So they could buy {A,B} or {B,D,E} for example.  f So if you wanted to find out every rule possible we would simply generate all the combinations of the list of prodcuts. In this case it would would come to $ {5 \\choose 1}$+$ {5 \\choose 2}$+$ {5 \\choose 3}$+$ {5 \\choose 4}$+$ {5 \\choose 5}$ combinations. Graphically this would look like the latice laid out below:\n","\n","</br>\n","\n","![Brute Frorce Approach](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_images/Brute_Force_Approach.png)\n","\n","\n","We would have a total of 31 possible combinations of rules or list of potential baskets.

It doesn't worry if someone bought 2 of the same item. So for example if someone's basket was {A,A,B}, then this would be considered to be {A,B}. It is clear that as we increase the number of products in our virtual store we are going to generate a substaninal amounts of possible combinations/baskets and finding the occurence of each basket would have an excessive load on computing power. \n","\n","Lets increase the number of products to 20. There is a 20 product list below the orignal 5 element list in the program above.

Can you think of strategy that might help the Virtual Store find the products that are associated with each other? \n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]}]}
