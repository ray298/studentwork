We will then outline a few examples of each definition. Get use to theses terms as quickly as you can because they will be used throughout this Topic.\n","\n","#**Definitions**\n"," \n","**Items I**\n","For each transaction database their is always a set of items that are finite (though they maybe very large)\n","\n",">> $ I =\\{i_1,i_2,...,i_m\\}$ where $i_m$ is an individual item and I is the complete set of items.\n","\n","**Transaction t**\n",">>> $t$ is a set of items and $t \\subseteq I$\n","\n","and $T$ is a set of transactions or a Transaction Database\n","\n","**Transaction Database T**\n",">> $T= \\{t_1,t_1,....,t_n\\}$\n","\n","So if we are to relate these definitions to a supermarket data we would have the following market basket transactions:\n","\n",">> $t_1 : \\{bread,Cheese,milk\\}$\n","\n",">> $t_2 : \\{apples,eggs, butter, yogurt\\}$\n","\n",">>   .\n","\n",">>   .\n","\n",">> $t_1 : \\{biscuit,eggs,milk\\}$\n","\n","So we are now going to define some concepts:\n","\n","* **An item $i$:** an item/article in a basket \n","* **$I$** is the set of all items sold in the store\n","* **A tansaction**: is the items purchased in the basket. It will most likely have a trasnaction ID (TID)\n","* **A transactional dataset*: a set of transactions\n","\n","So in association rule mining set theory definitions are used to decribe the rule structure.\n","\n","* A transaction t contains X, a set of items **(itemset)** in $I$, if $X \\subseteq t.$\n","\n","* An association rule is an implication of the form:\n",">> $X \\mapsto Y$, where $X, Y \\subset I$, and $X \\cap Y = \\emptyset$\n","\n","* An itemset is a set of items:\n",">> E.g. $X= \\{milk, bread, cerial\\}$ is an itemset\n","\n","So we have now defined what a rule is but we need some metrics to assess a proposed rule:\n","\n","**Suport**\n","\n","The support of X with respect to T is defined as the proportion of transactions $t$ in the dataset which contains the itemset X: \n","\n","\n","\n","> $supp(X)=\\frac{\\lvert t\\epsilon T;X \\subseteq t \\rvert}{\\lvert T \\rvert}$\n","\n","Support is an indication of how frequently an item is both. The support count of an itenset $X$, Denote by $X.count$ in a dataset $T$ is the number of transactions in $T$ that contain $X$, If we assume T has n transactions then you can  have support for a rule $X \\mapsto Y$  and it can be defined as :\n","\n","> $supp(X \\mapsto Y)=\\frac{(X \\cup Y).count}{n}$\n","\n","**Confidence**\n","\n","We can also define the confidence of a rule $X \\mapsto Y$, with respect to a set of transactions $T$, is the proportion of transactions that contains $X$ which also contains Y. It can be deifined as follows\n","\n",">  $conf(X \\mapsto Y)=\\frac{supp(X \\cup Y)}{supp(X)}$\n","\n","Note that $supp(X\\cup Y)$ means the support of the union of the items in X and Y. This is somewhat confusing since we normally think in terms of probabilities of events and not sets of items. We can rewrite $supp (X\\cup Y)$ as the probability $P(E_{X} \\cap E_{Y})$ where $E_{X}$ and $E_{Y}$ are the events that a transaction contains itemset $X$ and $Y$.\n","\n","Thus confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the conditional probability $P(E_y$ \\ $E_x)$ the probability of finding the RHS of the rule in transactions under the condition that these transactions also contain the LHS, Hahsler(2005)\n","\n","**Lift**\n","\n","Lift can be defined as \n","\n","</br>\n","\n",">$lift(X \\mapsto Y)=\\frac{supp(X \\cup Y)}{supp(X)xsupp(Y)}$\n","\n","Lift is effectively the observed support in ratio to that if the events were statisticall independent.\n","\n","</br>\n","\n","**Conviction**\n","\n","Conviction can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that $X$ occurs without $Y$\n","\n","</br>\n","\n",">$Conv(X \\mapsto Y)=\\frac{1-sup(Y)}{1-conf(X \\mapsto Y)}$\n","\n","</br>\n","\n","\n","**Example**\n","\n","We have now have 4 metrics that will allow us to make decisions about the relationship between rules. The following is a small transactional database:\n","![alt text](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_images/simple_transaction_database.png)\n","\n","Lets do a few calculations to make sure it all makes sense\n","\n","* $supp(Beef) = 4/7$\n","\n","* $supp(chicken) = 5/7$\n","\n","* $supp(Beef \\mapsto Chicken) = 3/7$ \n","\n","\n","* $conf(Beef \\mapsto Chicken) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{7}}{\\frac{4}{7}}$\n","\n","* $conf(\\{Beef,Chicken\\} \\mapsto Cheese)=\\frac{\\frac{2}{7}}{\\frac{3}{7}}$\n","\n","* $lift(Beef \\mapsto Chicken)=\\frac{supp(Beef \\cup Chicken )}{supp(Beef).supp(Chicken)} = $ $\\frac{\\frac{3}{7}}{\\frac{4}{7}.\\frac{5}{7}}$ \n","\n","Interpretating this results is a little tricky. A lift > 1 indicates a positive dependence or substitution. In other words if we have $Beef$ in our basket is there a likelihood that there will be $Chicken$. This term can be very useful as it vouches if there is a high(> 1) or low (\\< 1) association between products. In our case the Lift is 1.05 which implies there is an association between the 2 products. This type of metric will help store managers to make promotions and product placements.\n","\n","Now can you calculate the following:\n","\n","* $conf(\\{Beef,milk\\} \\mapsto Chicken)$\n","\n","\n","Toward Science have a nice [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/association-rules-2-aa9a77241654) that will help you understand these terms a little better.\n","\n","\n","\n"]}]}
