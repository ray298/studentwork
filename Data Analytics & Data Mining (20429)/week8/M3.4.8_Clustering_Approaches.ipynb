The next step of the \"Clustering\" journey is to outline an approach/algorithm that could be used to identify relevant clusters. The following is a list of potential cluster algorithm categories and the some of the algorithms that belong to them.\n","\n","\n","#Partitioning Approach\n","In these approaches we construct various partitions and then evaluate them by criterion such as minimizing the sum of square errors.\n",">* Typical methods: k-means, k-medoids, CLARANS\n","\n","\n","#Hierarchical approach:\n","we create a hierarchical decomposition of the set of data (or objects) using some criterion\n",">* Typical methods: Diana, Agnes, BIRCH, ROCK, CAMELEON\n","\n","#Density-based approach:\n","These approaches are based on connectivity and density functions\n",">* Typical methods: DBSACN, OPTICS, DenClue\n","\n","#Grid-based approach:\n","Grid-based approaches are based on a multiple-level granularity structure\n",">* Typical methods: STING, WaveCluster, CLIQUE\n","\n","#Model-based:\n","A model based approach used a hypothesized model for each of the clusters and tries to find the best fit of that model to each other\n",">* Typical methods: EM, SOM, COBWEB\n","\n","#Frequent pattern-based:\n","Are based on the analysis of frequent patterns\n",">* Typical methods: pCluster\n","\n","#User-guided or constraint-based:\n","Clustering by considering user-specified or application-specific constraints\n","\n",">* Typical methods: COD (obstacles), constrained clustering\n","\n","The slides I mentioned in Step [3.4.2](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_slides/Alternative_cluster_analysis_Presentation_2.ppt) give a lot more detail to each of the cluster approaches outlined above. Have a look at the references at the bottom of them as they could be really useful if you want to get into more detail. The book that these slides are based is called [Data Mining Concepts and Techniques](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/rdehkharghani/files/2016/02/The-Morgan-Kaufmann-Series-in-Data-Management-Systems-Jiawei-Han-Micheline-Kamber-Jian-Pei-Data-Mining.-Concepts-and-Techniques-3rd-Edition-Morgan-Kaufmann-2011.pdf). This is an excellent reference guide to the area.\n","\n","We are now going to implement a number of popular methods amd will discuss the pros and cons to each method.\n","\n"]}]}
