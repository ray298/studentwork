The goal is  to calculate the shortest distance between 2 points. With the euclidean distance the shortest distance will be that calculated by pythagoras or the hypotonus of a triangle (the green line in Figure 1). But obviously if your a taxi driver you cannot drive through buildings so you have to do an up and across motion.\n","\n","![alt text](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_images/Manhattan_distance.svg.png)\n","\n","Figure 1: [Taxicab geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry)\n","\n","So we now realise we cannot drive through buildings, which rules out the Euclidean distance as an appropriate formula:\n","\n",">>$d(p,q)={\\sqrt {\\sum _{i=1}^{n}(q_{i}-p_{i})^{2}}}$\n","\n","If we want to reflect the taxi drivers path then we should use the sides of each triangle. This  is effectively the Manhattan distance:\n","\n",">>$d(p,q)=\\sum_i^n\\lvert (q_{i}-p_{i}) \\rvert$\n","\n","This Manhattan distance metric is also known as Manhattan length, rectilinear distance, L1 distance or L1 norm, city block distance, Minkowskiâ€™s L1 distance, taxi-cab metric, or city block distance. In some cases it can be preferable to use as a distance measure as it can put less weight on outlying points. It has also been found to be benifical when you have a very high dimensional dataset.\n","\n","The code below is a very simple example of how it works using the scikit learn manhattan_distances library. Play about with it and compare it to the Euclidean distance.
