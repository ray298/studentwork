The subject was proposed by Agrawal et al in 1993 and has been used extensively by the database and data mining community. It assumes all the data are categorical and attempts to find realationships between categories or groups of categories. It was initially used for market basket analysis with the intention of understanding customer buying patterns. So for example if someone buys {potatoes, Onions} then are the likely to buy burgers. This is typically written as follows:\n","\n",">>$\\{potatoes, Onions\\} \\implies \\{burgers\\}$\n","\n","and there is no importance to the order. So in this example the order of Onions and Potatoes has no significance.\n","\n","The idea behind this concept was to identify shopping patterns. Understanding these patterns allows supermarkets to control their sales and even gives them a handle on products they need to buy.This may seem strange,but you should all be familiar with supermarket pricing promotions. So for example you may be offered soft drinks at a knock down price, but when you are in the supermarket the price of potato chips has remained the same. Supermarkets will have asked the suppliers of soft drinks and potato chips for a set schedule of promotions and 9/10 times they will coordinate these items together. They do this so they can boost their profits on potato chips and increase their margin on high volumes. The suppliers of both products are happy as they will be increase their sales and will only take a minor hit on margin. \n","\n","The concept has not just been applied to market basket analysis but also to web usage mining, intrusion detection, continous production and bioinformatics. \n","\n","Can you think of another example? But your thoughts on the comment board. I will point out that since the advent of online selling these assumptions are being seriously tested, so I suspect the high street retailers will have to change their sales mechanism to compete.\n","\n","In the next step we are going to look at a number of definitions and metrics that are used in Association Rule mining.\n"]}]}
