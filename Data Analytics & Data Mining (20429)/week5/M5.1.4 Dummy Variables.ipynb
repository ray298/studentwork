So if we were to code them we might use the numbers $\\{1,2,3\\}$, This does not mean that people in category $1$ are 3 times younger than those in catgeory $3$. So this causes a problem because they are not really numbers but categories with no real scale.\n",

        "The difference between the 2 equations is subtle but should not be ignored. In equation (1) we assume there is no intercept, thus the interpretation is that you have a variable intercept or a different intercept for each age category. In this case the $\\beta 's$ are the average sales for each group. If you use the dummy variable approach you the $\\alpha$ value is the equivalent to the effect of Adults and the remaining $\\beta$ parameters are the ratio between each of the other age categories and Adults. They are not the effect of each age catgory on sales. Now the method you use depends on the effect you want to study but do not include an $\\alpha$ with a hotencoded variable as you will induce multi-collinearity. If you are using Scikit-learn's linear regression model or stats-model you should specify if you want an intercept or not. For one-hot encoding, always set fit_intercept=False, in sklearn. For dummy encoding, fit_intercept should always be set to True? I do not see any \"warning\" on the website.\n",
