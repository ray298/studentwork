These processes while useful in understanding and preprocessing our data can also be considered data numerosity reduction techniques, as we are attempting to classify continous variables.\n","\n","Generally we have 3 types of attributes or features:\n","\n","* Nominal Variables - The values from an unordered set\n",">* (Male, Female)\n",">* (Yes/No)\n",">* (Conservative/Labour/Liberal/SNP/Green Party)\n","* Ordinal Variables - The values from an ordered set\n",">* Very Unsatisfied – 1\n",">* Unsatisfied – 2\n",">* Neutral – 3\n",">* Satisfied – 4\n",">* Very Satisfied – 5\n","\n","* Continous- These are real numbers and are often described as interval scales or ratio scales. Have a look at the following [link](https://www.questionpro.com/blog/ratio-scale/) for a more detailed explaination of ratio and intervalvariables.\n","\n","As we said in Topic 3 of this MOOC Discritization allows us to divide a continous variable into intervals/categories.\n","\n","Further to the techniques we have looked at in previous Topics in this MOOC we will look a very simple rule natural partitioning apporach known as the 3-4-5 rule and an entropy-based discretization method which takes account of the output variable when deciding on how to discretize an input variable.
