In real life siuations we may have to deal with 50,000+ features. This is can be very helpful but also challenges us to come with machinery and algorithms that can handle such scale. Sometimes this can be similar to lookig for a needle in a haystack when we are trying to extract insights from such vast datasets.\n","\n","In addition to the above, many of the machine learning algorithms that are available today specifically work as classifiers. So to use such algorithms you may need to convert a continuous variable into a categorical one.\n","\n","So are there ways to handle such problems?\n","\n","Well yes. In the next couple of steps we will address these problems as two broad groups of problems.\n","\n","* The first is Numerosity Reduction, which allows us to transform continous variables into categorical variables. The approaches we will look at for this group are:\n","\n",">*  Concept Hierarchies\n",">>reduce the data by collecting and replacing low level concepts (such as numeric values for the attribute age) by higher level concepts (such as young, middle-aged, or senior).\n","\n",">* Discretization\n",">> reduce the number of values for a given continuous attribute by dividing the range of the attribute into intervals. Interval labels can then be used to replace actual data values. We have covered some of the basics of this topic in previous topics but we will advance this to cover the concept of Entropy and information gain.\n","\n","* The second group covers the concept of dimensionalality reduction. This is a vast area which will be covered in much more detail in MOOC4. However, we will introduce a number of tools that you can use to get started with and they are:\n","\n",">* A light introduction to Principal Compnents\n",">* Lasso Regression\n",">* Ridge Regression\n","\n","Now lets get started.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YIItcJ1p2npP"},"source":[],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
