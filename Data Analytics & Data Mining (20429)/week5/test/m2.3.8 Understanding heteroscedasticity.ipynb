Heteroscedasticity occures when the variation in the error terms varies is not constant. It can be caused by the following:\n","\n","* when there is a large range between the largest and smallest observed values (outliers).\n","* When the model is not correctly specified \n","* If observations are from mixed scales (farenheit to celcius) \n","* Skewness  in the distribution of the regressor variable(dependent).\n","\n","From the above list we can see that we are assuming a linear model, but by using a linear model and examining the errors we can expose potential outliers in our data. I am not saying we have to stick with this model but using it initially can help you identify outlying observations. This [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heteroscedasticity-in-regression-analysis/) will help you understand what hetroscedasticity is and how to calculate it. Have a look and use the code I gave you in MOOC1 1 topic 3.9 to help you examine the boston housing data for outliers.\n","\n"]}]}
