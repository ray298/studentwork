The following list helps to further explain the general areas where it can be applied:  \n","\n","* Smoothing: remove noise from data\n","* Aggregation: summarization, data cube construction\n","* Generalization: concept hierarchy climbing\n","* Normalization: scaled to fall within a small, specified range\n",">* min-max normalization\n",">* z-score normalization\n",">* normalization by decimal scaling\n","\n","Analysts will transform data as a mater of convenience, to reduce skewness, make the data easier to view, convert nonlinear realtionships to linear or convert multiplicative relationships to additive. \n","\n","In the previous topics we discussed the processes of smoothing and data agregation. We will now discuss normalization, Concept Hierarchy and the use of transformation techniques to reduce our datasets without loss of information.\n","\n","\n"]}]}
