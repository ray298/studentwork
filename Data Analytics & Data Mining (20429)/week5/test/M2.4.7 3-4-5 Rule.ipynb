Suppose that profit data values for year 2017 for a company range from -3,51,\n","976 to +4,70,00,896.\n","\n","2. For practical purpose of avoiding noise, extremely high or extremely low values are not considered. So first we need to smooth out our data. Let’s discard bottom 5% and top 5% values.\n","\n","3. Suppose after discarding above data new values for LOW = -159876 and HIGH = 1838761.\n","\n","4. Most Significant Digit or MSD is at million position, see highlighted digit : –159876 and 1838761.\n","\n","5. Next step is to round down LOW and round up HIGH to MSD that million position.\n","\n","6. So LOW = -1000000 and HIGH = 2000000. -1000000 is nearest down million to -159876 and 2000000 is nearest up million to 1838761.\n","\n","7. Now let’s identify range of this interval.\n","\n","8. Range = HIGH – LOW that is 2000000 – (-1000000) = 3000000. We consider only MSD here which is 3.\n","\n","9. Now that we know range MSD = 3, we can apply rule #1.\n","\n","Rule #1 says that we can divide this interval into three equal size intervals:\n","\n","Interval 1 : -1000000 to 0\n","Interval 2 : 0 to 1000000\n","Interval 3 : 1000000 to 2000000\n","\n","You should be thinking of how 0 can be part of multiple intervals? You’re right! We should represent it as follows:\n","\n","Interval 1 : (-1000000 … 0]\n","Interval 2 : (0 … 1000000]\n","Interval 3 : (1000000 … 2000000]\n","Here (a … b] denotes range that excludes a but includes b.
