What we mean by multivariate outlier detection is the use of more than one variable to identify an outlier. In univariate outlier detection we looked for individual outliers in a single variable. These univariate outliers may not show up if there are unusual combinations between 2 or more variables. This is where multivatriate outlier detiection comes in. The same principles as mentioned  in univariate outlier detection can be applied with multivariate outliers. In otherwords don't exclude particular rows of data unless you scientific evidence to support this.</br>\n","</br>\n","\n","\n","There are numerous approaches to multivariate outlier detection, some of which are outlined below:\n","\n","\n","*   Bivariate Charts\n","> * Based on bivariate Normal assumptions\n","*   Depth Based control charts (nonparameteric)\n","> * Map n-dimensional data to one dimension using for example Mahalanobis\n","> * Build Control Charts for depth\n","\n","* Mutiscale process control wavelets\n","> * Detects abnormalities at multiple scales as large wavelett coefficients\n","> * Useful for data with hetroscedasticity\n","> * Used in chemical process control\n","\n","In this section we will specifically focus on the depth based control charts as it is a reasonably reboust process and is quite quick to set-up.

A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S.\\nCensus Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population\\nof 600 to 3,000 people).\\n\\nA household is a group of people residing within a home. Since the average\\nnumber of rooms and bedrooms in this dataset are provided per household, these\\ncolumns may take surprisingly large values for block groups with few households\\nand many empty houses, such as vacation resorts.\\n\\nIt can be downloaded/loaded using the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing` function.\\n\\n.. rubric:: References\\n\\n- Pace, R.
