Consider a concept hierarchy for the dimension location. City values for location include Vancouver, Toronto, New York, and Chicago. Each city, however, can be mapped to the province or state to which it belongs. For example, Vancouver can be mapped to British Columbia, and Chicago to Illinois. The provinces and states can in turn be mapped to the country (e.g., Canada or the United States) to which they belong. These mappings form a concept hierarchy for the dimension location, mapping a set of low-level concepts (i.e., cities) to higher-level, more general concepts (i.e., countries). This concept hierarchy is illustrated in the figure below.\n","![](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~amccarren/mcm_images/Concept_hierarchy.jpg)\n","\n","Many concept hierarchies are implicit within the database schema. For example, suppose that the dimension location is described by the attributes number, street, city, province_or_state, zip_code, and country. These attributes are related by a total order, forming a concept hierarchy such as “street < city < province_or_state < country.” This hierarchy is shown in Figure 4.10(a). Alternatively, the attributes of a dimension may be organized in a partial order, forming a lattice. An example of a partial order for the time dimension based on the attributes day, week, month, quarter, and year is “day <{month < quarter; week} < year.”\n","\n","Concept hierarchies may also be defined by discretizing or grouping values for a given dimension or attribute, resulting in a set-grouping hierarchy. A total or partial order can be defined among groups of values. An example of a set-grouping hierarchy for a price dimension, where an interval $(X…Y]$ denotes the range from $X$ (exclusive) to $Y$ (inclusive). This could be the conversion of the variable age to infant, teenager young adult or pensioner, defined by some predifned standard.\"\n","\n","Finally, in order to reduce data categories or numerosity an examination of the data warehouse can be incredibily or the application of standards is very useful. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LkCGBz-YU1eM","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nwK1qzQoVK5w","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]}]}
